# DFS-Optimization-Project
final project for CSE 710. Optimizing an NFL DFS lineup

This repository contains the code used in the final project for CSE 710: Engineering Optimization taught by Dr. Tim Davidson at McMaster University, completed in the Winter 2018 school term. The optimizer is powered by Gurobi (http://www.gurobi.com/index) and the academic license is currently valid until May 2019. I would like to continue working with this code when the NFL season begins in September 2018 and I hope to make updates during the season. Presently too many elements of the code are too ad-hoc for my liking. I would also like to practive developing a user interface for the code (vs. running a script in the R command line for example).
